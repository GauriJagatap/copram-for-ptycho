Run:

1) simulationDemo_sparse_compare
to compare various sparsity constrained super-resolution strategies, including Fourier sparsity, spatial sparsity, block sparsity,
under different levels of overlap.

2) simulationDemo_sparse
to select required sparsity constraint from either of Fourier,spatial or block models and generate results for the same.
